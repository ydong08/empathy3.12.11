    <desc>Create an account for one of the supported messaging services.</desc>

  </info>

  <title>Register a new account</title>

  <p>Most account types require you to create an account with a service
  provider before you can use that account with instant messaging applications.
  You can use <app>Empathy</app> to register for a new account with some
  account providers using the same steps as you would to
  <link xref="add-account">add an account</link>.</p>

  <p>Once you create a new account, your account provider should give you a
  login or a username and a password, as well as any additional information you
  need to connect using <app>Empathy</app>.</p>

  <section id="irc">
    <title>IRC</title>

    <p>IRC networks require that you specify a nick (nickname) when you connect
    to the server. Some IRC networks use a service, such as NickServ, to allow
    users to <link xref="irc-nick-password">protect their nick</link>. If you
    did not register your nick or are unable to do so and another user is using
    it, then you will need to choose a different one.</p>

    <p>Some IRC servers are password protected. You will need to know the
    password to connect to these servers. Generally, these are private IRC
    networks.</p>

    <note>
      <p>Many GNOME projects use <code>irc.gnome.org</code> for project-related
      discussion.</p>

  <section id="jabber">
    <title>Jabber</title>

    <p>Jabber is an open instant messaging system. Like email, Jabber allows
    you to choose your account provider and communicate with all other Jabber
    users, regardless of their account provider.</p>

    <p>You will need to create a new account with a Jabber provider. There are
    many free providers; one popular provider is
    <link href="http://register.jabber.org/">jabber.org</link>.</p>

    <note>
      <p>If you use Gmail or Google+ Hangouts, you already have a Jabber
      account. Use your Gmail address and password in <app>Empathy</app> to
      connect.</p>
    </note>

  <section id="salut">
    <title>People Nearby</title>

    <p>This service works whenever you are connected to a local network, such
    as a wireless hotspot, you do not need to create an account with service
    providor, just set up your account through <app>Empathy</app>. It
    automatically finds all other users on the network who are also using this
    service.</p>

    conversations over the Internet. You need to create an account with
    a SIP provider. You can communicate with all other SIP users,
    regardless of which SIP provider they use.</p>

    feature.</p>

    developed by different companies or organizations. <app>Empathy</app>
